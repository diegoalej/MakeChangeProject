- It asks and takes input from the user for the amount paid.
- It calculates the difference and rounds the number to two decimals.
- If the amount paid is not enough, it gives an error message.
- If the amount paid is exact, it thanks the user.
- If the amount paid is more that the item, it outputs a String with the exact change breakdown
